                            <p>At the beginning of the program we received a very difficult but beautiful challenge named “Empowering Women and Youth in developing countries through STEM education and entrepreneurship.” The challenge is based on two sustainable development goals “quality education” and “gender equality.” However, since the beginning we knew we don’t want to get restricted with only two goals, our intention was to combine few others. We knew it would be a daunting task but we felt proud to be able to work on such global problem. </p>
                            <p>The 21st century we live in is not perfect. There are many countries that cannot provide quality education to their population. And what is even more worrying is that women in many countries around the world do not have same rights or access to education as men because of the culture or other circumstances. At this point we knew we must face the challenge carefully and responsibly and consider different traditions, cultures and mentalities. We knew we must be very open minded and consider and understand the challenge from all perspectives. </p>

                            <h3>Why CORTEX</h3>
                            <p><em> Cortex to empower Youth:</em>The inspiration for our project is the true story of two brothers Mohammad and Mah- moud, Syrians refugees whom we have interviewed during our research. After a long and tough journey, they are now living in Spain. With great efforts Mohammad managed to bring his academic certificates to Spain. This allowed him to find a decent job in his field of expertise and apply to a master degree. However, Mahmoud couldn’t bring his academic certificates as he was in the middle of his studies when he had to flee Syria. Today he is not able to finish his studies and find a decent job as he lost everything and can’t prove his academic qualifications to resume his life. It may sound unbelievable, but today in the 21st century people can lose the power to use their education, and one of the reasons is the current anachronic system of educational certificates based on paper and middle-men verification.</p>
                            <p><em>Cortex to empower women:</em>CORTEX will empower Hani, a talented young woman from Senegal. CORTEX + MOOC shall enable Hani to have access to quality education from the best institutions in the world without leaving Senegal. She will be able to choose the most attractive and enriching courses to her and build a personalized aca- demic program in line with the most updated curricula. What it is most revolutionary is that she can get an official degree that nowadays is simply unreachable for her. Imagine the benefits that this could have for women with limited financial resources, or with cultural restrictions for traveling abroad, or young single mothers.</p>
                            <h3>What is CORTEX</h3>
                            <p>CORTEX is a decentralized and distributed network that keeps safe and verifies individual aca- demic records. CORTEX is a private blockchain with only an academic purpose, in which the courses approved and degrees obtained by a student are recorded as transactions in the student personal profile. Using blockchain we can create a decentralized and reliable system, and by using biometrics technologies we can create a paperless system which is always available to the users. </p>
                            <h3>How to implement CORTEX</h3>
                            <p>We envision CORTEX as a sustainable nonprofit organization. The profits generated are first reinvested on maintaining the system, while the remaining is reimbursed to the academic institutions that support the system as computing nodes. Our main objective is to onboard prestigious institutions for the first three years and demonstrate the value proposition of using CORTEX, we will then move to onboarding group of institu- tions and eventually envision CORTEX to be a global protocol.</p>
                            <p>Among many success factors in the implementation of CORTEX, a rapid adoption from the ramp-up stage is vital. The system needs to on board academic institutions to scale, and a minimum initial number of nodes to achieve the functional level of the blockchain. And here is where CERN has the amazing opportunity to play a leading role in the early stage of this new system. As a respected institution by the academic world can influence the early adopters to achieve network effect, and with its computing grid facilitate the nodes needed at launch stage. Thus, we envision CORTEX powered by CERN. </p>

                            <h2>Early researches, first overview</h2>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the early stages team WU started to investigate and understand the challenge. The Ideas we came up during the first week following the design thinking methodology were an inspiration and reference point throughout the entire journey. We realized communication and brainstorming were crucial factors for better understanding of the problem. </p>
                                <p>Team Wu started by understanding the design thinking process and applying it for our challenge. This firstly led to brainstorming of the topic “Empowering Woman and Youth in Developing Countries through STEM and entrepre- neurship”. Team focused on woman as a subject and investigated different stages and obstacles woman face in both developing and developed countries. We have created a timeline of woman‘s life and defined three critical mile- stones that impact her life and career. After extensive desktop research we have identified three crucial ages; the age range of 5-7, 16+ and 25+. In each age range, we defined different life situations. </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Idea 1: Mathagotchi</li>
                                    <li>Idea 2: Time Maker</li>
                                    <li>Idea 3: Skype Avatar</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h3>Mathagotchi</h3>
                                <p><em>USER:</em> A child 5-7 years old is in the main stage of brain development and is more vulnerable to external influences. Research showed that girls lose confidence around this age and are vic- tims of external stereotypes. This means that girls start to be worse at math than boys, because social stereotypes are set up this way. Also, less and less people in the future pursue STEM carriers and according to our research it is due to the unengaging school system; simply put it is because math is not fun. </p>
                                <p><em>IDEATION</em> One of the considerations were to make math gender equal and fun. This could be achieved via gamification system and therefore the main inspiration was Tamagotchi - the virtual animal” that kids feed and take care of and to interact with other similar devices.</p>
                                <p><em>SOLUTION</em> We created Matchagotchi, that would be based on a similar system as Tamag- otchi. Kids would have a virtual “animal”to feed through solving mathematical problems, and would be able to engage with “other players”and compete. </p>
                                <p><em>TESTING</em> We have tested our idea with other teams and the conclusion from the interviews was that it would be an useful solution, but the main challenge is we can’t exactly define or mea- sure the impact for the future. It should be developed and extensively tested for many years with many users to measure the impact.</p>
                                <h3>Time Maker</h3>
                                <p><em>USER</em> Second user (16+) is a young woman from a developing country who got into a difficult life situation. She got pregnant at very young age and has neither financial nor moral support. Due to her parental duties, she is not able to continue or begin her studies as her immediate priority is to earn money. Due to lack of time, she is not able to get educated, which means she can’t get a decent job. </p>
                                <p><em>IDEATION</em> Brainstorming showed that the main challenge for her is lack of time. </p>
                                <p><em>SOLUTION</em> We created a conceptual, very futuristic solution to solve the problem of lack of time. The product was named Time Maker and the system was based on smart watch that is collecting data from the user and adjusting time according to user’s needs. Which in practice means that the user does not see real time but sees the time that she needs.  </p>
                                <p><em>TESTING</em> Even though the idea was liked and appreciated there were many challenges to im- plement the idea. It is very complex and not feasible as there are many external factors that are very important for product to exist.</p>
                                <h3>Skype Avatar</h3>
                                <p><em>USER</em> Next user is woman 25+. She is from developed country; fresh graduate of STEM based university and is trying to apply for STEM related jobs. However, the problem she is facing is that being a woman she is not taken seriously in STEM field and has less opportunities than her male peers.  </p>
                                <p><em>IDEATION</em> We thought that the big problem in the field is the gender stereotype. Therefore, in such case we intended to erase gender equality when applying for male driven jobs. </p>
                                <p><em>SOLUTION</em> The Skype plugin named Avatar would be the gender eraser where it would allow to hold an incognito skypes with interviewer. Which means, interviewer would not know what gender the person is and would be able to fully focus on the response of the interviewee.  </p>
                                <p><em>TESTING</em> Testing showed many things that weren’t considered. Such as, the solution is not solving the real global problem, it is only hiding it. </p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="contentboxed">
                                <h2>Needfinding</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>Since very beginning we knew that the scope of our challenge is very broad and the topic seemed to be very abstract and we realized we don’t have enough knowledge about such global problem. Therefore, each team member began to research about the challenge. Dealing with a task as broad as the one we were facing, with strict time constraints, meant making numerous decisions, under considerable uncertainty, knowing that equally attractive alternatives were being left behind. We understood that the problems vary depending on the culture, country etc., therefore the solu- tion for empowerment would not be perceived the same in different locations. </p>
                                    <p>The initial goal of the team was to make an impact, start very specifically but later to be able to scale it globally. Of- ten, we had to face obstacles and uncertainties, but thanks to them we were able to move forward and solve them by talking with numerous stakeholders. However, thanks to the team’s spirit and drive, we were able to soon discover very interesting information we didn’t know before and as such we narrowed our research down to one specific per- sona. </p>
                                    <p>Initially, we clearly focused on women and education. However, during the extensive deskop research we saw a po- tential within multiple users. Therefore, we decided to focus on six areas that drew our attention. </p>
                                    <h3>The focus areas were the following</h3>
                                    <p><em>LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AMONG YOUNG GIRLS</em></p>
                                    <p>During research, we found out that social stereotypes have great impact on girl perception in the future. Especially, when her role models (usually parents) behave according to the stereotypes.</p>
                                    <p><em>INDIAN GIRL THAT DROPPED OFF SCHOOL</em></p>
                                    <p>Many girls in India drop out of school usually due to house chores, cultural stereotypes or financial instability. Most of them don’t have the support or the will to continue. </p>
                                    <p>Problems: Parents have huge expectations from boys and encourage them to study. When it comes to girls, parents have no expectations and don’t want to take chances. </p>
                                    <p><em>SYRIAN REFUGEE</em></p>
                                    <p>Refugees face personal crises when they flee their country and suddenly appear at refugee camp. Moving from camp to the new host country is very long process and therefore many of them might stay for several months, even years. However, many of them are young people that haven’t finished school and would like continue education. On the other hand, even refugees who have their degrees can’t use them as they are not valid in camps. Another problem is lack of common language at the camp. </p>
                                    <p><em>PROJECT GAMBIA</em></p>
                                    <p>Organization is working on skills development among youth in Gambia. They are mainly focusing on vocational train- ing and agricultural skill development. </p>
                                    <p><em>CHINESE GIRL FACING BIG GAO-KAO TEST</em></p>
                                    <p>Chinese school system is one of the strictest system in the world. Kids appear to be under enormous pressure when about to finish high school. The entire success and the future of the individual is based on big Chinese, national test, named Gao-Kao. The score of the test also distinguish social level. This is big problem for girls. Girls that get a low score, have problems to get married or get the job. </p>
                                    <p><em>WOMAN APPLYING FOR HIGHER JOB POSITION IN SPAIN</em></p>
                                    <p>Women in developed countries are facing discrimination when it comes to higher job positons. Most of the compa- nies refuse to hire women or give less salaries for women.  </p>
                                </div>
                                <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>In order to get closer understanding of the problem, team was jumping between ideas and fields of research in order to cover as much information as possible. After individual research done by each team member, we narrowed scope down to three areas. Since we already had higher knowledge on the problem, we were able to decide relevant direc- tion for our next stage of the research. </p>
                                </div>
                                <h2>Rounds of investigation</h2>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <h3>How might we make 15-20 year girls financially independent? </h3>
                                    <p><em>PERSONA</em> Gopi is 16 years old girl from India. She lives with middle class family and stays home in order to help her parents with house chores.</p>
                                    <p><em>PROBLEM</em> Gopi’s family want her to stay at home and help them with household activities & learn how to cook. They want to get her married soon and start saving for her wedding. She wants to study more and dreams to work. She wants to be financially independent. She wants her voice to be heard. </p>
                                    <p><em>NEED</em> Empowerment for a 15-20 girl in India means financial independence. When it comes to boy’s parents are thinking about their career, for girls they think about marriage, also the support girls get for education is usually very less. Hence there is a strong need to make girls financially independent to give them a voice.</p>
                                    <p><em>CURRENT SITUATION</em> There are some interventions, but most of the solutions offered are to devel- op skills of the girls in the community and they work on skill development for courses such as beautician, tailoring etc. which are very limited and don’t expose the girls to all the possible jobs.</p>
                                    <p><em>PROPOSED SOLUTION</em> We want Gopi to learn new skill and get exposure to jobs outside her com- munity. The solution we propose is creating a platform where Gopi can learn new skills, get exposure while earning virtual currency which can be used for her education. The kids part of our network will work with corporates for their team building activities. That way we want to develop real world skills among young girls and bolster their confidence that they can earn money by applying their skills.</p>
                                    <h3>How might we provide entertaining gender free education?  </h3>
                                    <p><em>PERSONA</em> 6+ kids attending elementary school in developed countries. </p>
                                    <p><em>PROBLEM</em> Kids are having troubles knowing what they really want to do or study because of stigmas and stereotypes. Low self-esteem is the main thing that blocks these kids to fights against these stereotypes.</p>
                                    <p><em>NEED</em>Increase self-esteem and decrease of the fear to fail </p>
                                    <p><em>CURRENT SITUATION</em>There are a lot of platforms and educational applications to encourage kids to train their skills, but they don‘t give professional feedback and statistics to students. Also, most of them are not used in the schools, or if they are, they are not used at home. Kids see these platforms as a teacher tool to approach them, not as a tool for them to learn and self-control their performance. </p>
                                    <p><em>PROPOSED SOLUTION</em> An educational platform that not only helps kids to learn and develop their skills but also gives them an accurate feedback so they are aware of their knowledge and their capacities. Then, they can make their own decisions based on that information, as well as demonstrate them that each knowledge they gain is because of them.</p>
                                    <h3>How might we support refugees to continues education or get a job in their host countries?   </h3>
                                    <p><em>PERSONA</em>20+ Syrian refugee that fled his country and lost all hos documents. Now he is in his new country not being able to prove his past. </p>
                                    <p><em>PROBLEM</em> Among the many challenges refugees have to face, to prove their previous qualifi- cations and skills prevent them from continuing their studies or finding a job once they arrive to a host country. Even more when they had to flee their homes without any document (ID, passport, certificates). In some cases, the institutions at home country will no longer be able to provide any verifiable document. </p>
                                    <p><em>NEED</em>To prove previous studies and skills when no verifiable document is available.</p>
                                    <p><em>CURRENT SITUATION</em>There few programs, in Greece and Norway for example, in which Refugees are going through assessment processes that involves questionnaires and structured interviews with credential evaluators. This may take several weeks or months, consuming not only time, but also resources from institutions, host countries and refugees themselves.</p>
                                    <p><em>PROPOSED SOLUTION</em> A blockchain among educational institutions around the world in which the academic records, linked to biometrics identification, are kept and verified, so even in the case of loss of all identity documents, no one will lose his/her studies and skills antecedents anymore.</p>

                        <p>Our solution, CORTEX, is designed as a long-term project divided in 2 stages. The first phase is focused on empow- ering youth in general by giving them back the power to use their education. While the second phase will use the solution of stage 1 as the foundation to enable women in developing countries to have access to quality education. </p>

                            <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
                            <p>It may sound unbelievable, but today in the 21st century people can lose the power to use their education, and one of the reasons is the current anachronic system of educational certificates based on paper and middle-men verification. Nowadays, a paper is the only valid proof of academic background. If we lose it, eventually we could go back to our countries and get a new one. However, many people are not able to do so, meaning that they are unable to retrieve their academic credentials permanently. </p>
                            <p>One bold example is the true story of two brothers, Mohammad and Mahmoud, Syrians refugees that we interviewed during our research, who after a long and tough journey are now living in Spain. Mohammad managed, with great effort, to bring his academic certificates to Spain. This allowed him to find a decent job in his field of expertise and apply to a master degree. On the other hand, Mahmoud was about to graduate after 4 years of studies by the time he had to flee Syria. So, he could not bring any academic certificate. Today he is not able to finish his studies nor find a decent job. In terms of official education, he lost everything. </p>
                            <p>Therefore, Mahmoud needs to prove his academic qualifications to resume his life. The problem is that to do so he needs to get his academic certificates back in Syria, personally, which is almost impossible. Moreover, his refugee status forbids him to return to his country. This is not only wrong, but it is also extremely worrying, because the pres- ent problem of Mahmoud could be the problem of the future displaced people, a group that due to political, religious or climate change situations will grow from 65 million today to 150 million in 2050. And it is also very concerning because besides the extreme case of displaced people, the current system of academic certificates can affect any migrant in general, whose number will reach 334 million in 2050. </p>
                            <h3>What are the current solutions?</h3>
                            <p>Mahmoud has 2 alternatives to solve his problem considering the impossibility to personally request his certificates in Syria. The first one is the black market, in which a member of his family would need to pay an “agent” for getting the paperwork done in the absence of Mahmoud. This is not only illegal, but risky and costly. </p>
                            <p>The second option is to apply for a European Qualifications Passport, a document that provides an assessment of the higher education qualifications based on available documentation and a structured interview (COE, 2017). The Council of Europe leads this program, and although is not available in Spain yet, it is expected that in 2018 it will be available at distance using online tools. Nevertheless, although the program could be a great help for many current refugees, it is hardly scalable if we consider that each process takes several weeks to be completed, and what it is more important, it requires up to 7 qualified people and 3 full working days to handle one single case. Putting this in the context of millions of people that may require it in the future, this solution will not be enough. </p>
                            <h3>How can we solve it?</h3>
                            <p>Considering the problem and the restrictions of the current alternatives to solve it, we define our first objective as to provide future young refugees a technological tool that will allow them to prove their aca- demic qualifications no matter what situation or where they are. We are focusing on refugees despite knowing the problem also affects migrants, at some degree, it could affect everyone, because if we solve it for the extreme case i.e. people who lost not only their academic certificates, but also ID documents, or whose academic institutions are gone for good, we will solve it for everyone. And to do so, we aim to change the paradigm, leaving behind the current centralized certification system based on paper to adopt a decentralized and digital one. </p>
                            <h3>What is our solution?</h3>
                            <p>CORTEX is a decentralized and distributed network that keeps safe and verifies individual academic records. To do so it uses blockchain and biometrics technologies. With these two together we can create a solution that considers the jobs that have to be done that our research, observation, and analysis of refugees as extreme case and the academic institutions as main users provided us:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Paperless, a piece of paper cannot be the only way of proving academic background - Verifiable, meaning that middle men will not be needed anymore</li>
                                <li>Decentralized, no dependant on institutions location or situation</li>
                                <li>Secure</li>
                                <li>Proof of degrees, but also courses completed</li>

                            <p>Among many success factors in the implementation of CORTEX, a rapid adoption from the ramp-up stage is vital. The system needs to onboard academic institutions to scale, and a minimum initial number of nodes to achieve the functional level of the blockchain. And here is where CERN has the amazing oppor- tunity to play a leading role in the early stage of this new system. As a respected institution by the academic world, it can influence the early adopters to achieve network effect, and with its computing grid can facilitate the nodes needed at launch stage. Thus, we envision CORTEX powered by CERN. </p>
                            <div class="imagefullwidth">

                            <p>In terms of computing requirements, CORTEX would be infinitesimal to CERN’s computing grid capacity. If nowa- days its network processes 2 petabytes of data per day, CORTEX’s whole network would weight only few gigabytes in total. Just as a reference, the size of a massive blockchain as Bitcoin is currently at 146 gigabytes, and this is much larger than what CORTEX could ever reach.. </p>

                            <p>As we mentioned, CERN could be a key promoter and facilitator, and this contribu- tion could be permanent if it decided to. However, we have thought the system in a way that, if needed, CERN can reallocate its resources to new projects after some time. Also, we foresee an evolution in terms of technology and system configuration. This is CORTEX roadmap in terms of computing resources, biometrics technology, and ways of users’ access. </p>

                            <p>The computing resources would start on CERN computing grid only, then it will migrate to EGI grid while first aca- demic institutions join. Next stage would be EGI and a higher number of academic institutions, ending only with the latter ones once the system is fully adopted. The biometrics could evolve from fingerprints to facial recognition once the technology is widely available in developing countries. And in the long term it could also be linked to DNA or other advanced technology available. The access to the system, specifically how a user can retrieve and share her cre- dentials, will evolve from only at academic institutions part of the network during the recognition and early adoption stages, to an access from any device once smartphone and biometrics is vastly available in the less developed regions. </p>

                            <h3>How can CORTEX help to empower women?</h3>
                            <p>To answer this, first we must travel in time and imagine a future in 20 - 25 years. A future in which CORTEX is globally adopted as a protocol, and therefore, all our academic records are safe, and immediately verified through CORTEX system. Additionally, the access to internet via different devices and biometrics technology are widely available in developing countries. Now, let us add MOOC technology on top of CORTEX system </p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Pairing CORTEX with MOOC would mean that courses remotely completed will be recorded and linked to our biometrics and added to our official academic credentials.</p>
                            <p>How impactful could this be? If CORTEX would mean the decentralization of the academic certificates system, CORTEX + MOOC could mean the decentralization of education itself. To have an idea about the impact of this, let us think on Hani, a talented young woman from Senegal. </p>
                            <p>Cortex + MOOC shall enable Hani to have access to quality education from the best institutions in the world with- out leaving Senegal. She will be able to choose the most attractive and enriching courses to her, build a personalized academic program in line with the most updated curricula, and then, what it is most revolutionary, get an official and recognized degree that nowadays is simply unreachable for her. Imagine the benefits that this could have for women with limited financial resources, or with cultural restrictions for traveling abroad, or simply young single mothers. </p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Cortex is a blockchain based global network of academic institutions aiming to store academic records in a secure, reliable, distributed and permanent way. The students of institutions that are part of Cortex, will get their academic records into the system, and will be able to retrieve them using their fingerprint.</p>
                            <p>We are creating a private blockchain, this means that it can only be used the academic institutions (nodes) allowed to participate in it. Using blockchain technology makes our system distributed and permanent. It is distributed be- cause information of every academic record in the system is replicated in every node, and it’s permanent because blockchain ensures that once a piece of data has been accepted in the blockchain, it cannot be modified by any node of the network.</p>
                            <p>Each academic record of a user (student) is recorded to the blockchain as a transaction from the issuing academic institution to the user. Transactions in Cortex are verified thanks to digital signatures. If a node wants to issue an academic record to a specific user, it will create a cryptographically signed transaction that will be broadcasted to the rest of the network. The other nodes can verify that the transaction is coming from a certain institution using the digital signature. </p>
                            <p>When users need to retrieve their academic records, they just need to access the system through their biometrics, which for the moment would be the fingerprint due to its reliability and low cost. Firstly, once the students enroll to a university, they need to provide their fingerprint. The institution will then register all the student records into the system. Therefore, when a new user is created, his fingerprint is provided to cipher the information in Cortex. That means they scan the fingerprint with a sensor compatible with the system and its array of features is stored (it can be seen as the hash value of someone’s fingerprint).</p>
                            <p>The sensor being compatible means that the features extracted and represented are the same in every sensor part of the system so as to be able to the match and retrieve the records in all the institutions part of Cortex. The array of features stored in the system will be used to identify a user with his/her fingerprint but also to generate a key which will give access to the private key associated to a particular student. This private key will allow to read the data ciphered in the blockchain with a public key. To make sure that an unauthorized individual cannot enter the system, the function that generates the key that protects the private key of a user is a secret. Finally, the private key of the user will give access to the records stored in the blockchain and protected with the public key. </p>

                        <h2>Final prototype</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Our goal with our prototype of Cortex was to show how a university with students registered in the system could input records into secure and immutable system and how the user would be able to retrieve his/her records in any other academic institution using his/her biometrics, which cannot be lost. Therefore, we could prove that our idea for never losing our academic records is powerful and feasible. </p>
                            <p>Our demo consisted of two parts. In the first one, we showed how a user can register and input an academic record to Cortex in one computer. In the second part, the user’s academic records were retrieved just using the user’s fin- gerprint in another computer.</p>
                            <p>Hardware Material: 
                                    - Adafruit optical fingerprint sensor - Arduino UNO - 2 LEDs (red and green) - 2 resistors 
                                    - Cables </p>
                            <p>Both computers were running a local server, an Ethereum Testnet client, and a Python script listening to a fingerprint scanner that was attached to the computer through an Arduino with a USB cable. The user interacted with Cortex through a website powered by the local server. </p>
                            <p>The web server was built using Node.js and Express (a Node.js web application framework). The website had 3 basic functionalities: </p>

                            <p>To do the authentication, there was a program running on the Arduino that was scanning fingerprints in an infinite loop. Once a fingerprint was scanned, it was compared to the database of fingerprints: if there was a match, a green LED lighted up and a text file was created with the identification of that user. </p>
                            <p>Otherwise, if there was a mismatch, a red LED lighted up and no file was created. </p>
                            <p>In case a match occurred, the server read the information in the text file, so it would be able to know which user was trying to access to their records. </p>

                            <h3>Probelms we faced</h3>
                            <p>One of the biggest problems we faced was that we wanted to do the matching of the fingerprints in the computer, comparing the current hash value with the stored when the user was enrolled. The problem was that the two finger-print sensors that we were using were not exactly the same and the hash values obtained were not similar at all. To solve that, we registered the same fingerprints in both sensors and related to the same identifier, so when a user put his fingerprint the system identified him correctly. </p>
                            <p>Another problem we had to deal with was that, at the beginning, we wanted to be able to enroll new students that have not scanned their fingerprint before as well as scan the fingerprints and do the matches. However, we did not know how to communicate the server with the Arduino so that when we clicked somewhere in the website, the system could generate an interruption that automatically was communicated to the Arduino. For that reason, we previously input our fingerprints and did the demo with our team as the only users of Cortex. </p>
                            <p>Also, to make it easier for us to do the demo, we decided to use the Ethereum Testnet instead of creating a private blockchain just for the prototype. The result was the same because the records were uploaded to the blockchain so they were immutable and always accessible. However, in that case the blockchain was public so anyone could read and add records with the appropriate software. </p>

                        <h2>Business Model</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>We envision CORTEX as a sustainable nonprofit organization. The profits generated are first reinvested on maintain- ing the system, while the remaining is reimbursed to the academic institutions that support the system as computing nodes. Our main objective is to onboard prestigious institutions for the first 3 years and show the value proposition of using CORTEX, we will then move to onboarding group of institutions and eventually envision CORTEX to be a global protocol. </p>
                            <h3>Product Development Plan</h3>
                            <p>For the first 6 months, we want to develop a minimum viable product and test it with a minimum of 2 institutions and 5 users. Our team has 3 developers with programming experience in Blockchain, Biometrics and UI. We have already created a basic version of our product with 2 weeks of development effort. Hence our team is confident to build a stable version in 6 months. We will hire a full-time developer with expertise in blockchain to help us with the system architecture. Our designers will help with the user experience, hence there is no need to hire an UX expert. We have a sales specialist in our team who will lead the process of talking with the institutions and onboarding them. </p>
                            <p>After 6 months, we will have a stable version and we will onboard few academic institutions for a 50% discounted annual subscription rate of 1500 Euros. After year 1, we will onboard new institutions for a full annual subscription rate of 3000 Euros. This cost if justified based on our interactions with academic institutions as they will have signif- icant savings when they move from the current manual process to a system which requires less manual intervention. </p>
                            <h3>COST</h3>
                            <p>The main cost involved in the development of CORTEX is human resources, server cost , the computational power for the mining process and the biometrics device. </p>
                            <p><em>Human Resources</em>We have 6 founders who will be working on CORTEX part time. We will be hiring a full-time developer with experience in blockchain. In year 3, we will hire a full-time sales person to reach more institutions and to target groups of institutions. Note: Refer appendix for details on the cost.</p>
                            <p><em>Biometrics device</em>Each device costs 30 Euros, as we scale this cost can be reduced to 15 Euros. </p>
                            <p><em>Server and computational cost</em>We estimate a 5% bill of materials, which covers the server and the cost of the bio- metrics device. The computational cost is covered using the per transaction fee users pay. </p>
                            <h3>REVENUES</h3>
                            <p>We have 3 major revenue streams which cover all the costs as shown below. The annual fees paid by the academic institutions powered by our system, except for those in the developing countries. This fee covers the cost of de- velopment of the product, server cost and the cost of the biometric device. Transaction fees paid by corporates or users that request verification of credentials of applications. This fee covers the cost of the computational power required for the mining process which verifies the academic records. Finally, donations from international organiza- tions, philanthropists and impact investors will be used to subsidize the transaction cost for refugees. </p>
                            <h3>FUNDING PLAN</h3>
                            <p>We will raise a funding of 100k Euros to fund the development of cortex. As we envision CORTEX as a nonprofit sustainable organization we will raise this money from impact investing firms. Using this 100k we will be able to de- velop the MVP and onboard academic institutions. Starting from year 3, we have a self-sustainable business model. Refer appendix for detailed cash flow, P&L and balance sheet. </p>
