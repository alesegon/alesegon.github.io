How people relate to each other and to the world is increasingly fast, open and interactive. Such an attitude is challenging brands and companies to gain speed and agility and to define images as lively and dynamic. “Fluid” is a research project focused on the methodology of flexible design systems for brands.

                            #fluid is born as the corporate identity for the present. The image is based on the speed of today’s changes and is representing it through an evolving shape that is affected by the number of interactions of the users on social media. The effect on the form varies depending on the hashtags used on the mentioned interactions and is divided according to the different topics.
